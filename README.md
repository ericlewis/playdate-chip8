# playdate-chip8
Chip-8 emulator for playdate. It has been so long that I don't remember where I found the C code for this, if someone locates it - I will update the readme.

## Controls
* Left Arrow: move left on keyboard
* Right arrow move right on keyboard
* A Button: select (and hold) keyboard key
* B Button: release selected keyboard key

## Known issues
- Switching ROMs results in games memories bleeding together :laughing:
- Chip8 input is ill suited to playdate
